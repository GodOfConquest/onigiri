An old-fashioned aggregator site for light novel fan translations. 

(^Being built by a biologist who obviously has not made a web application before).

Key Features (what I think I can do):
-------------------------------------
* English-only support
* Chapter-by-Chapter linking to external fan translations
* Moderation of newly added links
* Popularity rankings and ratings of light novel series
* Categories and searching
* Recent updates and RSS

Dream Features (what I'd like to do):
-------------------------------------
* Multilingual support
* Option for hosted translations/content
    * Revision tracking
    * Inline Commenting/Suggestions/Collaboration -- fancy editors; this is an application in itself
    * Manuscript Permissions (give edit permissions to other users, groups, or even everyone)
* Fancy UI and user-friendliness
    * User-customizable backgrounds, fonts, styles, for online reading
    * Bookmarking for users 
* API
    * Android App
    * IOS App
    * PDF/EPUB generator
* Series-specific forums (Not pHpBB; integrated into web app)
* Translator/Translation Group-Oriented Features:
    * Customizable Translation Group Pages (like tumblr styling)
    * Journals/Blogs for translation groups
    * Private/Public forums for translation groups and their members
    * Statistics
    * IN SHORT: A TRANSLATION GROUP HOST (like wordpress is a translation group host)

Why Am I Making an Aggregator?
==============================
I strongly believe that aggregators are the best way to spread the popularity of light novels
(and fan translations) in the English-speaking West. My mission statement, so to speak, is to
popularize light novels yet do it in an ethical, noncommercial, and responsible way.

There are three major features that I think are most important: 

1). The ability for readers to easily find new novels to read. Aggregators are best at this because
They keep rankings of what others find interesting, and have ways for readers to search based on 
certain categories. This is the most important role I'd like for an aggregator like this to fill.

2). Convenience. Users don't really like to travel across multiple links and be forced to read using
the UI chosen by each translation group (or be exposed to ads or distractions). Users should be able 
to read using the fonts that are easy on their eyes and with backgrounds they like.

3). HUGE: Portability. In my opinion the future of light novel translations will be for smartphones.
People *want* to download and read light novels on the bus, train, or airplane--when they're traveling
and don't necessarily have WI-FI or internet connection. The Baka-Reader app is one step in this
direction, but its selection is limited to only Baka-Tsuki projects. The goal for onigiri is to 
produce a (secure) environment that more translators would be willing to be post their translations to
without worrying about anons or other random individuals editing their manuscripts. 
Combined with an effective API, it's possible for us as a community to make portable fan-translations
possible.

What Do I Need to Make this Possible?
=====================================
* Developers willing to work with me (please contact me!)
* Someone willing to host the web application
    * Temporarily, I'll be able to put things on Heroku, but only while things stay small and not very noticeable  
* Someone willing to administrate it (b/c I'm just a developer here!)
